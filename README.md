# Convex-Hull-Line-Interection-DAA-Project

In this project, We are required to implement the following problems using geometric algorithms
with various Big Oh complexities. Users can add the point on screen made on Java Swing & implement auto point generator in JavaScript In this we showed a very nice user interface
steps of used algorithms and all various steps of algorithms must be clearly shown. In addition,
we also show the steps how to Time and Space complexities of each algorithm.

• Line Intersection

o Orientation Method 

o Sweep Line Intersection

o Hertel-MehlHorn

• Convex Hull Solution 

o Brute Force

o Jarvis March

o Graham scan


o Quick Elimination

o Divide And Conquer

o Orientation Method 

o SweepLine Intersection

o Hertel-Mehlhorn

We have implemented all these Algorithms in Java as well as a few in JavaScript to show it more user-friendly Interface
Also, we have to submit the report made on LaTex.
